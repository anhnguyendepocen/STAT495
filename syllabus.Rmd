# Course Description

* **Official course description**: On [Amherst College
Webpage](https://www.amherst.edu/academiclife/departments/courses/1718F/STAT/STAT-495-1718F)
* **Unofficial course description**: A course on the theoretical underpinnings
of machine learning. Fundamental concepts of machine learning, such as
crossvalidation and the bias-variance tradeoff, will be viewed through both
statistical and mathematical lenses. As much of the coursework will center
around participation in [Kaggle competitions](https://www.kaggle.com/), there
will be greater emphasis on supervised learning techniques including regression,
smoothing methods, classification, and regularization/shrinkage methods. To this
end, there will be a large computational component to the course, in particular
the use of tools for data visualization, data wrangling, and data modeling.
Furthermore, to encourage engagement with the open-source statistics, data
science, and machine learning communities, work and collaboration will center
around the use of GitHub.
* **Objectives**: This semester you will
    1. Synthesize what you've learned in your statistics, data science, mathematics, and computer science courses in a less structured setting than a typical course.
    1. Learn to communicate empathetically when doing group work.
    1. Develop your presentation skills and ability to think on your feet.
    1. Implement the ideas behind a ["minimum viable product"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup#Definitions) into your workflow.
    1. Empower yourselves to actively participate in the open-source code/data ecosystem, necessitating understanding of GitHub pull requests.

# Lectures

* A typical lecture will consist of some balance of:
    * "Chalk talk": Old-school talks on the blackboard where we'll either
        + Prime the discussion for the day
        + Give an "executive summary" or a "bird's eye view" of a topic
        + Go over more theoretical content
    * "Tech time": Unstructured time for you to either
        + Read digital content
          + Work with your seatmates on in-class exercises
          + Start problem sets
* The flow of the lecture notes will follow the [main page](index.html) of the course.   


## Attendance policy

I do not take explicit attendance, so there is no need to inform me of the occasional absences. That being said, abuse of this policy will eventually catch up to you (see [Engagement](#engagement) below). Furthermore, please ask your peers what you missed in case of absence.

## Lecture schedule

Roughly speaking we will cover the following topics. A more detailed outline and corresponding readings can be found
[here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSoT25RqvzJrr563nky-ANl_EiM39NruG2fkH8fykFxMwk8JXILo5AbdEKtJabcBQ2QM41ab4MDe7Ab/pubhtml?gid=1289440669&single=true).

1. Background
    * Intro to modeling
    * Simple case to start: splines
    * Out-of-sample prediction, sampling/resampling, crossvalidation
    * Bias-variance tradeoff
1. Continuous outcomes I
    * LOESS smoother
    * Regression for prediction
1. Categorical outcomes i.e. classification
    * Logistic regression for prediction + ROC curves
    * k-Nearest Neighbors
    * Classification and regression trees (CART)
1. Continuous outcome II
    * Regularization/shrinkage methods: Ridge regression and LASSO
1. Other methods
    * Boosting and bagging
    * Random forests
    * Neural nets
1. Unsupervised learning (time permitting)
    * Principal components analysis
    * k-Means Clustering

# Materials

We will use chiefly use the following available textbooks:

1. ["Happy Git and GitHub for the useR"](http://happygitwithr.com/) by Jenny Bryan.
1. ["An Introduction to Statistical Learning"](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/) by James, Witten, Hastie, and Tibshirani.
1. ["Computer Age Statistical Inference"](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/CASI/) by Efron and Tibshirani.

# Evaluation

## Group Final Project 30%

Much of this course is a build up to the final project. You will be
participating in a Kaggle competition.

* All groups members are expected to contribute and a system will be put in
place to hold your group peers accountable for their work.
* As per the Amherst College Student Code of Conduct's statement on
[intellectual responbisility and plagiarism](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism) **all external sources must be cited in your submissions**.
* More details and examples will be posted later in the semester.


## Weekly Problem Sets 20%

The problem sets in this class should be viewed as low-stakes opportunities to
practice, instead of evaluative tools used by the instructor to assign grades.

* All problem sets assigned/due/presented on Tuesdays 
* Basic structure:
    1. You will be randomly assigned into pairs.
    1. You will complete the problem set and submit it via GitHub pull request.
    1. On the due date, I will pick a certain number of teams at random to present their findings.
    1. You will have the option of updating your submissions.
* Policy on collaboration:
    + While I encourage you to discuss problem sets with your peers, you must submit
your own answers and not simple rewordings of another's work.
    + As per the Amherst College Student Code of Conduct's statement on [intellectual responbisility and plagiarism](https://www.amherst.edu/offices/student-affairs/community-standards/intellectual-responsibility-and-plagiarism) **all collaborations must be explicitly acknowledged in your submissions**.
* Lowest two scores dropped.
* No extensions for problem sets will be granted. 


## Three Midterms 40%

There will be three midterms: two during the semester, one during finals week (dates posted under [Basic information](#basicinfo)).

* Two highest scores are weighted 15% each, lowest is weighted 10%. 
* All midterms are cumulative.
* There will be no make-up nor rescheduled midterms, except in the following
cases if documentation is provided (e.g. a dean's note):
    + serious illness or death in the family.
    + athletic commitments, religious obligations, and job interviews if
    prior notice is given. In such cases, rescheduled exams must be taken
    *after* the rest of the class.
* There will be no extra-credit work to improve midterm scores after the fact.

## Engagement 10% {#engagement}

It is difficult to explicit codify what constitutes "an engaged student," so 
instead I present the following rough principle I will follow: *you'll only get
out of this class as much as you put in*. Some examples of behavior counter to
this principle:

* Not participating in in-class exercises.
* Engaging so little with me, either in class or during office hours, that I
don't know what your voice sounds like.
* Submitting a problem set that has code or content that is copied from or is
only a slightly modified version of your peers' work.

# Inclusion and Accessibility
 
I strive to make this course welcoming to all students. If you would like to
discuss your learning needs with me, please schedule a meeting. I look forward
to working with you to understand and support your academic success.
 
In particular, if you have a documented disability that requires accommodations,
you will need to register with Accessibility Services for coordination of your
academic accommodations. You can reach them via email at
<accessibility@amherst.edu>, or via phone at 413.542.2337. Once you have your
accommodations in place, I will be glad to meet with you privately during my
office hours or at another agreed upon time to discuss the best implementation
of your accommodations.
