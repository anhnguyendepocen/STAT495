## Tool 3: Kaggle

* Baby's first Kaggle competition entry!
* Tutorial on their most popular competition for beginners [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).



## Titanic Data

For $i=1,\ldots,n$ passengers

* ID variable: `PassengerId`
* Outcome variable $y_i$: `Survived` (binary)
* 10 Predictors/covariates $\vec{X}_i$ i.e. information about the passenger: `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`. 



## Models for Predicting Survival:

NaÃ¯ve models: Use no information about the passenger, i.e. no covariates

1. Everyone dies: Predict
    + `Survived == 0`
1. Everyone lives: Predict
    + `Survived == 1`
1. Flip a weighted coin. Predict
    + `Survived == 1` with probability $p$
    + `Survived == 0` with probability $1-p$


## Models for Predicting Survival:

* Instead, let's use some information about the passengers: `Sex`? 
* Our model: Predict:
    + `Survived == 1` if `Sex == "female"`
    + `Survived == 0` if `Sex == "male"`



## Outline of Competition

Chalk talk i.e. see your lecture notes. 



## Titanic Data

Load CSV's into R:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# library(tidyverse)
# gender_submission <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/gender_submission.csv")
# test <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/test.csv")
# train <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/train.csv")
```

* You may need to change your directory path.
* `readr::` just indicates the function is from the `readr` package. Use for disambiguation.



## Training Set

The binary outcome varible `Survived` is included.

```{r}
# glimpse(train)
```


## Test Set

`Survived` is now **NOT** included. There are 418 rows (passengers) you need to predict.

```{r}
# glimpse(test)
```


## Submission Example

This is what you submit: 418 rows with

> * the ID variable `PassengerId`
> * your **predicted** outcome variable `Survived`

```{r}
# glimpse(gender_submission)
```


## Submission Example

You can write to CSV via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# gender_submission %>% readr::write_csv("assets/Titanic/submission.csv")
```


## Submission Example

After submitting to Kaggle, you can see your ranking.

## What is machine learning?

</br>

</br>


## My philosophy

> * **Question** What is the difference between statistics, data science, and machine learning?
> * **Answer** Ben Baumer at Smith posed: "Instead of obsessing over Venn diagrams of what topics are within the domains of which disciplines, I ask instead": What if we blew up math, stats, CS, and all their legacies and started over? What would this field look like/be called?"


## Definitions

* Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Albert Y. Kim (2017): Prediction. Examples:
    + [Self-Driving Vehicles](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/)
    + [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) recommendations
    + Simple linear regression *for prediction* and *not for explanation*

## Setting up infrastructure

1. Intro to Slack
1. Intro to Kaggle
1. Intro to GitHub


## Intro to Slack

* Slack is a medium for communication that has many pros (and some cons)
* I require you to use Slack via the [Desktop App](https://slack.com/downloads/)
* Student [feedback](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UZmhutoc17ZoWqf6jX9-m_8Ewvw6amVu__X0MMqlbEU)


## Tech time

* Make sure you've completed the [intro survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/17tNYB4VqEfXvxvNvIhVvb5OmsTldXQ19OdCYUyYzvl0/edit)
* Install the Slack [Desktop App](https://slack.com/downloads/)
* GitHub
    + If you don't have a [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) account already, create one.
    + Update your name and post a *recent* profile picture.
* Take a break


## Slack

<!--
1. Slack team
1. Slack channel
1. Direct messages: individual, group, to yourself
1. Mentions
1. Sharing code:
    1. in-line using `
    1. Code blocks using ``` and shift+enter
1. File drag and drop
-->

* Chalk talk: 1.1 Slack
* Exercise: 
    + Send me your GitHub login via direct message (DM)
    + Practice sending group DM with seatmates
* Key for Slack success: Setting notifications
