Baby's first Kaggle competition and GitHub pull request! Specifically the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>) competition. You will be submitting predictions on who survived/died amongst the passengers randomly assigned to the *test set* and viewing your Kaggle leaderboard score.

* Assigned: Thu 9/7
* Due: Mon 9/11 9:00am
* Make sure your full name and photo are visible [here](https://github.com/orgs/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/people).

# 1.4 Intro to splines

## Today: Tue 9/12

Announcements: New office hours location: Seeley Mudd 208 (lounge)

# Problem set 2

<a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market">
<img border="0" alt="Sberbank" src="images/sberbank.png" width="600">
</a>

You will enter the [Sberbank Russian Housing Market](https://www.kaggle.com/c/sberbank-russian-housing-market) Kaggle competition and fit a spline model to predict the outcome variable `price_doc`: the sale price of a piece of real estate. The data has been pre-downloaded and included in the [PS02 repo](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS02) in the course GitHub Organization.

* Assigned: Tue 9/12
* Due: Tue 9/19 9:00am, at which point there will be synchronized pull requests.
* Teams: 2-3 people at your choosing. Once you've selected your group designate one person as team leader, who will:
    + Create a Slack DM that includes Albert, Andrew Kim (TA), and all team members.
    + Submit a single pull request on behalf of the group.
    + Submit a single submission to Kaggle on behalf of the group.
* Deliverables: One ready to submit *pull request* to the [PS02 repo](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS02) (recall the GitHub [submission process](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/README#problem-set-submission-process)). At the very least, the following files should be modified/added:
    1. `PS02.Rmd`: This should
        + Be well-commented and completely reproducible.
        + Involve an *exploratory data analysis*.
        + Argue why you chose the model you did.
    1. `PS02.html`: The output of `PS02.Rmd`. This will be the presentation file for a randomly chosen set of groups on Tue 9/19.
    1. `submission.csv`: Your predictions of who survives based on something other than sex. Current set to match `gender_submissions.csv` on Kaggle.
    1. `screen_shot.png` or `screen_shot.jpg`: A screenshot of your Kaggle ranking.
* Tips:
    + Again, do not worry about your score. This problem set is more about process more than outcome.
    + Do not [spin your wheels](https://youtu.be/VrS14wLmVhY?t=12s)!

# Problem set 1

Baby's first Kaggle competition and GitHub pull request! Specifically the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>) competition. You will be submitting predictions on who survived/died amongst the passengers randomly assigned to the *test set* and viewing your Kaggle leaderboard score.

* Assigned: Thu 9/7
* Due: Mon 9/11 9:00am
* Teams: Individual
* Deliverables: A ready to submit *pull request* to the [PS01 repo](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS01), in other words complete only [steps 1-5](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/README#problem-set-submission-process) of the problem set submission process. However, you will all be submitting/making the pull request (step 6) at the same time as a group in lecture. The following files should be modified/added from the original
    1. `PS01.Rmd`: This should be well-commented and **completely reproducible**. In other words, if someone else takes this repo, they should be able to reproduce your work with one click of the mouse. This necessitates taking an empathetic view of other users.
    1. `PS01.html`: The output of `PS01.Rmd`
    1. `submission.csv`: Your predictions of who survives based on something other than sex. Current set to match `gender_submissions.csv` on Kaggle.
    1. `screen_shot.png` or `screen_shot.jpg`: A screenshot of your Kaggle ranking. Be sure to "clean" your browsers.
    1. Any other necessary files.
* Tips:
    + This problem set is only about getting used to the process, not about anything substantive. 
    + You don't have to fit actual model for now, but feel free to if you want. Don't even worry about how good your predictions are, just focus on getting a score.
    + Do not [spin your wheels](https://youtu.be/VrS14wLmVhY?t=12s)! If you are stuck, take a breather, and consult others.
* **Note added 9/7 1:30pm**: There is an error in `PS01.Rmd`; replace line 4 of `PS01.Rmd` so that it reads:

```
date: "2017-09-07"
```

# 1.2 Getting used to infrastructure

## Today: Thu 9/7

Announcements:

* Refresher on Slack notifications
* GitHub organization for the course: Where problem sets will be distributed/submitted
    + Ensure you can access the GitHub organization by clicking "GitHub Org" above.
    + If BOTH your full name and/or a recent picture are not visible [here](https://github.com/orgs/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/people), please update your GitHub profile.

Topics:

* GitHub pull request theory
* Kaggle competition

## GitHub pull request theory

* Open the following in two separate tabs
    + [Problem set 1](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS01)
    + [Problem set submissions process](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/README#problem-set-submission-process) 
* Chalk talk: 1.2 GitHub pull requests

## Kaggle data

* Run the code block below to load/inspect the [Titanic data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle (which I've uploaded to the course webpage)
* Chalk talk: 1.2 Kaggle data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
train <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/STAT495/static/Titanic/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/STAT495/static/Titanic/test.csv")
submission <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/STAT495/static/Titanic/gender_submission.csv")

glimpse(train)
glimpse(test)
glimpse(submission)

View(train)
View(test)
View(submission)
```

## Who is predicted to survive?

The predictions are based on the sex of the passengers.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
test %>% 
  left_join(submission, by="PassengerId") %>% 
  select(PassengerId, Sex, Survived)
```

## Tech time

* Questions:
    1. What is the "scoring" mechanism for this Kaggle competition?
    1. What score does the above "model" yield for the `train`ing data?
* Start problem set 1




***



# Problem set 0

* Assigned: Tue 9/5
* Due: Thu 9/7 lecture time.
* Set up Git/GitHub to interface with RStudio on your computer by reading and following along to
Chapters 1-15 of ["Happy Git and GitHub for the
useR"](http://happygitwithr.com/)
* If you start spinning your wheels, don't panic! I'll have office hours on
Thursday 2-5pm to help out if you are stuck.

# 1.1 Syllabus and background

## Today: Tue 9/5

* Albert's background
* Go over syllabus
* Setting up infrastructure
    1. Intro to Slack
    1. Intro to Kaggle
    1. Intro to GitHub


## Your instructor

<http://rudeboybert.rbind.io/>



## What is machine learning?

</br>
<center><img src="images/data_science_3.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/></center>
</br>


## My philosophy

> * **Question** What is the difference between statistics, data science, and machine learning?
> * **Answer** Ben Baumer at Smith posed: "Instead of obsessing over Venn diagrams of what topics are within the domains of which disciplines, I ask instead": What if we blew up math, stats, CS, and all their legacies and started over? What would this field look like/be called?"


## Definitions

* Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Albert Y. Kim (2017): Prediction. Examples:
    + [Self-Driving Vehicles](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/)
    + [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) recommendations
    + Simple linear regression *for prediction* and *not for explanation*


## Syllabus
