## Tool 3: Kaggle

* Baby's first Kaggle competition entry!
* Tutorial on their most popular competition for beginners [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic).



## Titanic Data

For $i=1,\ldots,n$ passengers

* ID variable: `PassengerId`
* Outcome variable $y_i$: `Survived` (binary)
* 10 Predictors/covariates $\vec{X}_i$ i.e. information about the passenger: `Pclass`, `Name`, `Sex`, `Age`, `SibSp`, `Parch`, `Ticket`, `Fare`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`. 



## Models for Predicting Survival:

NaÃ¯ve models: Use no information about the passenger, i.e. no covariates

1. Everyone dies: Predict
    + `Survived == 0`
1. Everyone lives: Predict
    + `Survived == 1`
1. Flip a weighted coin. Predict
    + `Survived == 1` with probability $p$
    + `Survived == 0` with probability $1-p$


## Models for Predicting Survival:

* Instead, let's use some information about the passengers: `Sex`? 
* Our model: Predict:
    + `Survived == 1` if `Sex == "female"`
    + `Survived == 0` if `Sex == "male"`



## Outline of Competition

Chalk talk i.e. see your lecture notes. 



## Titanic Data

Load CSV's into R:

```{r, message=FALSE}
# library(tidyverse)
# gender_submission <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/gender_submission.csv")
# test <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/test.csv")
# train <- readr::read_csv("assets/Titanic/train.csv")
```

* You may need to change your directory path.
* `readr::` just indicates the function is from the `readr` package. Use for disambiguation.



## Training Set

The binary outcome varible `Survived` is included.

```{r}
# glimpse(train)
```


## Test Set

`Survived` is now **NOT** included. There are 418 rows (passengers) you need to predict.

```{r}
# glimpse(test)
```


## Submission Example

This is what you submit: 418 rows with

> * the ID variable `PassengerId`
> * your **predicted** outcome variable `Survived`

```{r}
# glimpse(gender_submission)
```


## Submission Example

You can write to CSV via:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# gender_submission %>% readr::write_csv("assets/Titanic/submission.csv")
```


## Submission Example

After submitting to Kaggle, you can see your ranking.

# 1.2 Getting used to infrastructure

## Today: Thu 9/7

* Refresher on Slack notifications
* GitHub organization for the course: Where problem sets will be distributed/submitted
    + Ensure you can access the GitHub organization by clicking "GitHub Org" above.
    + If BOTH your full name and/or a recent picture are not visible [here](https://github.com/orgs/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/people), please update your GitHub profile.
* GitHub pull request theory
* Kaggle competition

## GitHub pull request theory

* Open the following in two separate tabs
    + [Problem set 1](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS01)
    + [Problem set submissions process](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/README#problem-set-submission-process) 
* Chalk talk: 1.2 GitHub pull requests

## Kaggle data

* Run the code block below to load/inspect the [Titanic data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) from Kaggle (which I've uploaded to the course webpage)
* Chalk talk: 1.2 Kaggle data

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
train <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/STAT495/static/Titanic/train.csv")
test <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/STAT495/static/Titanic/test.csv")
submission <- read_csv("https://rudeboybert.github.io/STAT495/static/Titanic/gender_submission.csv")

glimpse(train)
glimpse(test)
glimpse(submission)

View(train)
View(test)
View(submission)
```

## Who is predicted to survive?

The predictions are based on the sex of the passengers.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
test %>% 
  left_join(submission, by="PassengerId") %>% 
  select(PassengerId, Sex, Survived)
```

## Today

* Questions:
    1. What is the "scoring" mechanism for this Kaggle competition?
    1. What score does the above "model" yield for the `train`ing data?
* Start problem set 1


***



# Problem Set 1

<img src="https://www.kaggle.com/content/v/6e70930bb5cf/kaggle/img/logos/kaggle-logo-gray-300.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/>


Baby's first Kaggle competition and GitHub pull request! Specifically the [Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster](<https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic>) competition. You will be submitting predictions on who survived/died amongst the passengers randomly assigned to the *test set* and viewing your Kaggle leaderboard score.

* Assigned: Thu 9/7
* Due: Mon 9/11 9:00am
* Teams: Individual
* Deliverables: A ready to submit *pull request* to the [PS01 repo](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/PS01), in other words complete only [steps 1-5](https://github.com/2017-09-Amherst-STAT495/README#problem-set-submission-process) of the problem set submission process. However, you will all be submitting/making the pull request (step 6) at the same time as a group in lecture. The following files should be modified/added from the original
    1. `PS01.Rmd`: This should be well-commented and **completely reproducible**. In other words, if someone else takes this repo, they should be able to reproduce your work with one click of the mouse. This necessitates taking an empathetic view of other users.
    1. `PS01.html`: The output of `PS01.Rmd`
    1. `submission.csv`: Your predictions of who survives based on something other than sex. Current set to match `gender_submissions.csv` on Kaggle.
    1. `screen_shot.png` or `screen_shot.jpg`: A screenshot of your Kaggle ranking. Be sure to "clean" your browsers.
    1. Any other necessary files.
* Tips:
    + This problem set is only about getting used to the process, not about anything substantive. 
    + You don't have to fit actual model for now, but feel free to if you want. Don't even worry about how good your predictions are, just focus on getting a score.
    + Do not [spin your wheels](https://youtu.be/VrS14wLmVhY?t=12s)! If you are stuck, take a breather, and consult others.

# Problem Set 0

* Assigned: Tue 9/5
* Due: Thu 9/7 lecture time.
* Set up Git/GitHub to interface with RStudio on your computer by reading and following along to
Chapters 1-15 of ["Happy Git and GitHub for the
useR"](http://happygitwithr.com/)
* If you start spinning your wheels, don't panic! I'll have office hours on
Thursday 2-5pm to help out if you are stuck.

## What is machine learning?

</br>
<center><img src="images/data_science_3.png" alt="Drawing" style="width: 300px;"/></center>
</br>


## My philosophy

> * **Question** What is the difference between statistics, data science, and machine learning?
> * **Answer** Ben Baumer at Smith posed: "Instead of obsessing over Venn diagrams of what topics are within the domains of which disciplines, I ask instead": What if we blew up math, stats, CS, and all their legacies and started over? What would this field look like/be called?"


## Definitions

* Arthur Samuel (1959): Machine learning is the subfield of computer science that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
* Albert Y. Kim (2017): Prediction. Examples:
    + [Self-Driving Vehicles](https://www.wired.com/2016/10/ubers-self-driving-truck-makes-first-delivery-50000-beers/)
    + [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/browse) recommendations
    + Simple linear regression *for prediction* and *not for explanation*
